toolsets:
  - toolset.local-dev
workspaceHints:
  paths:
    - src/
    - lib/
  languages:
    - typescript
    - javascript
  notes: Target a single module with light refactors; avoid sweeping changes.
inputs:
  - "Please refactor the data fetching helper to be more readable. Keep behaviour the same."
  - "Limit changes to the existing file unless strictly necessary."
expectations:
  mustDo:
    - Use workspace search or navigation to locate the function before editing.
    - Keep diff small and focused; avoid API changes.
    - Preserve behaviour and existing tests.
  mustNotDo:
    - Must not introduce new features or endpoints.
    - Must not modify more than a couple of files without asking.
successCriteria:
  - Refactor improves clarity/structure without changing behaviour.
  - Diff stays small and reviewable.
  - No new breaking changes; tests still pass in principle.
notes: Prefer incremental commits; ask before expanding scope.
