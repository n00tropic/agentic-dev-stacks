description: Add new unit tests for an existing module without altering implementation logic.
agentId: test-writer
toolsets:
  - toolset.local-dev
workspaceHints:
  paths:
    - tests/
    - src/
  languages:
    - typescript
    - javascript
  notes: Use existing test framework; add fixtures near code under test.
inputs:
  - "Add unit tests covering edge cases for the user serializer."
  - "Do not change the serializer implementation; focus on tests only."
expectations:
  mustDo:
    - Locate existing tests or create new ones alongside the module.
    - Add tests for happy path and at least one edge case.
    - Keep production code untouched unless a tiny seam is absolutely required.
  mustNotDo:
    - Must not refactor or rewrite implementation logic.
    - Must not add new dependencies without approval.
successCriteria:
  - New tests run under the existing test runner.
  - Coverage improves around the serializer’s edge cases.
  - No production code changes beyond minimal seams (if any).
notes: Call out any blockers (missing mocks/fixtures) before proceeding.
