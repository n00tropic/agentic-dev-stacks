# 30-infra-devops-platform

Infra, DevOps, and platform engineering: Docker, Kubernetes, IaC (Terraform), CI/CD, YAML toolchain.

## Intent

- Canonical, reusable VS Code configuration for this domain.
- Always includes GitHub Copilot, Codex, and core QA tooling by default; vendor-neutral infra extras remain opt-in.
- Designed to be OS-agnostic: works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
