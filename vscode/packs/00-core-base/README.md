# 00-core-base

Global base profile: Codex-first defaults with GitHub Copilot, QA tooling, and universal editor settings shared by all other packs.

## Intent

- Canonical, reusable VS Code configuration for this domain.
- Always includes GitHub Copilot, Codex, and core QA tooling by default (vendor-neutral add-ons stay optional).
- Designed to be OS-agnostic: works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
