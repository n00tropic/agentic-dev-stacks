# 00-core-base

Global base profile: Copilot, Codex, QA defaults, and universal editor settings shared by all other packs.

## Intent

- Canonical, reusable VS Code configuration for this domain.
- Always includes GitHub Copilot, Codex, and core QA tooling by default.
- Designed to be OS-agnostic: works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
