# 40-docs-knowledge

Docs, technical writing, and knowledge systems: Markdown, AsciiDoc, SSGs (Docusaurus, Antora), diagramming.

## Intent

- Canonical, reusable VS Code configuration for this domain.
- Always includes GitHub Copilot, Codex, and core QA tooling by default.
- Designed to be OS-agnostic: works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
