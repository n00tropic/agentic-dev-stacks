# 20-python-data-ml

Python services, data tooling, and ML/AI work: uv/poetry, notebooks, testing, linting, and type-checking.

## Intent

- Canonical, reusable VS Code configuration for this domain.
- Always includes GitHub Copilot, Codex, and core QA tooling by default; vendor-neutral tooling remains opt-in.
- Designed to be OS-agnostic: works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
