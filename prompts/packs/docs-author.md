# Prompt Pack: Docs & Knowledge

- Audience-first: assume mixed engineering/product readers; prefer short sections with examples.
- Style: en-GB; keep Oxford commas; avoid US spellings. Use active voice.
- Sources: prefer MCP doc/search servers; cite versions when recommending APIs.
- Structure template:
  - Purpose (what, who)
  - Prereqs (versions, roles, access)
  - Steps (numbered, each with expected outcome)
  - Verification (how to confirm success)
  - Rollback / support (links, commands)
- Diagrams: suggest Mermaid or Kroki blocks only when they clarify flows.
- Safety: flag privacy_sensitive servers before querying the open web; default to offline sources.
