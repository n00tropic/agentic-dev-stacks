= MCP Integration

How MCP manifests become usable Codex config.

== Sources

- Manifests: `vscode/packs/*/mcp/servers.<slug>.json`
- Each server entry: `id`, `human_name`, `category`, `source`, `config_fragments`, flags (`optional`, `experimental`, `privacy_sensitive`, `recommended_read_only`).

== Merge workflow

[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
python scripts/merge-mcp-fragments.py core-base-dev fullstack-js-ts infra-devops docs-librarian
----

Result:

- `vscode/codex-mcp.generated.toml` (local, not committed)
- Commented metadata showing which profiles contributed each server
- `<TO_FILL>` placeholders for commands/args/env to be filled from official server docs

== Applying to Codex

1. Open your `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `%USERPROFILE%/.codex/config.toml`).
2. Copy only the `[mcp_servers.*]` blocks you want from `codex-mcp.generated.toml`.
3. Replace `<TO_FILL>` with real commands/args/env.
4. Save and restart Codex/IDE if needed.

== Safety and flags

Use manifest flags to decide what to enable:

- `optional`: leave out unless needed.
- `experimental`: keep to experimental-preview contexts.
- `privacy_sensitive`: enable only where external logging is acceptable.
- `recommended_read_only`: prefer read-only operations (e.g. get/list/watch).

== Bundles

Bundles may include a slug-scoped generated MCP TOML for convenience, but it is still treated as a generated artefact. Do not commit `codex-mcp.generated.toml`; regenerate when manifests change.
