= Safe vs Danger Modes for MCP and Codex

This guide explains how to reason about safe vs danger modes when using MCP servers with Codex.

== 1. Mental model

Two dimensions drive risk:

1. Codex sandbox / execution mode (filesystem, shell, network power).
2. MCP server capabilities (read-only vs mutating, external APIs, cloud actions).

“Danger” usually means a permissive sandbox **and** powerful MCP servers. “Safe” constrains at least one of these.

.Risk Assessment Model
The combination of sandbox permissions and MCP capabilities determines the overall risk level.

== 2. Safe-mode patterns (read-mostly)

Use safe mode by default for unfamiliar repos or shared environments.

- Prefer restrictive sandbox (e.g. workspace-write, limited/no network).
- Choose read-only/introspective MCP servers (docs, search, logs, metadata).
- Avoid deploy/delete/write operations.

Example (conceptual):

[source,toml]
----
approval_policy = "always"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

[features]
rmcp_client = true
web_search_request = false

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = false
----

== 3. Danger-mode patterns (full access, trusted contexts)

Acceptable for trusted repos and intentional automation (build, refactor, deploy).

[source,toml]
----
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"

[features]
rmcp_client = true
web_search_request = true

[sandbox_danger_full_access]
network_access = true

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
----

Treat this like a powerful automation account; enable only when comfortable with the blast radius.

== 4. Using MCP safety flags

Each `servers.<slug>.json` includes:

- `optional`: safe to omit.
- `experimental`: enable in experimental contexts only.
- `privacy_sensitive`: may log data to third parties; enable only in suitable contexts.
- `recommended_read_only`: prefer read-only usage (e.g. get/list/watch).
- `category`: hints at capability (dependency-intelligence, docs, database, search, cloud, etc.).

Practical guidance:

- Optional: include only if needed.
- Experimental: keep to `experimental-preview` or non-critical setups.
- Privacy-sensitive: enable only when external logging is acceptable.
- Recommended read-only: consult server docs to disable mutations; use read-only kubeconfigs/DB creds where relevant.

== 5. Example MCP patterns

Read-only cluster (conceptual):

[source,toml]
----
[mcp_servers.kubernetes-ro]
command = "<TO_FILL>"
# args = ["--read-only"]
# env = { KUBECONFIG = "/path/to/readonly/kubeconfig" }
----

Full-access cluster (trusted only):

[source,toml]
----
[mcp_servers.kubernetes-rw]
command = "<TO_FILL>"
# args = ["--allow-writes"]
# env = { KUBECONFIG = "/path/to/admin/kubeconfig" }
----

== 6. Decision rules

- Do I trust this repo? If not, choose safer sandbox + minimal MCP set.
- Could an error cause real damage? Be conservative for prod clusters/DBs/cloud.
- Does this MCP write or call externals? Treat as high-risk.
- Is this always-on or one-off? Enable powerful MCPs only when needed.
- What do the flags say? Optional/experimental/privacy_sensitive mean explicit opt-in.

== 7. Recommended workflow

- Keep two configs if helpful: a normal config and a safe config.
- Use this repo for structure (manifests, generator, docs), not for your personal `config.toml`.
- After repo changes: re-run the merge script for relevant slugs, review output, update your configs.
