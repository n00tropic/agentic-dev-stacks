= Agentic Dev Stacks

A reproducible, agent-friendly scaffolding for VS Code profiles, MCP manifests, custom Copilot agents, and bundles. This site mirrors the repository structure and governance.

== What this project provides

- VS Code packs (profiles, extensions, settings, MCP manifests) under `vscode/packs/**`.
- Bundle compiler: packs -> exports -> bundles/zips with workspaces, MCP, custom agents.
- Codex/MCP guidance and safety modes.
- Governance and agent rules (AGENTS.md).
- Prompt packs and custom Copilot agents per profile.

== Where to start

- Codex/MCP config: xref:codex:config-guides.adoc[]

== Governance

Follow AGENTS.md and CONTROL.md when editing packs, MCP, or agents. Never edit user dotfiles; regenerate exports/bundles instead.
