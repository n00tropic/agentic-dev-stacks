.Architecture Overview
High-level architecture showing the relationship between packs, build system, outputs, and documentation.

== What this project provides

- VS Code packs (profiles, extensions, settings, MCP manifests) under `vscode/packs/**`.
- Bundle compiler: packs -> exports -> bundles/zips with workspaces, MCP, custom agents.
- Codex/MCP guidance and safety modes.
- Governance and agent rules (AGENTS.md).
- Prompt packs and custom Copilot agents per profile.

== Where to start

- Golden Path: xref:golden-path.adoc[]
- Packs & bundles: xref:vscode:packs.adoc[] and xref:vscode:bundles.adoc[]
- Codex/MCP config: xref:codex:config-guides.adoc[]
- Agent rules & custom agents: xref:agents:agents-overview.adoc[]

== Governance

Follow AGENTS.md and CONTROL.md when editing packs, MCP, or agents. Never edit user dotfiles; regenerate exports/bundles instead.
