= Golden Path (new machine)

This is the minimal, repeatable path to bootstrap a profile on a fresh machine.

== Repo-aware path

. Clone the repo and enter the vscode directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
python scripts/export-packs.py core-base-dev
----
. Install extensions into the profile (scoped):
+
[source,bash]
----
cat exports/workspaces/core-base-dev/.vscode/extensions.list | \
  xargs -L1 code --install-extension --profile "Core / Base Dev"
----
. Open the workspace with the profile:
+
[source,bash]
----
code exports/workspaces/core-base-dev/core-base-dev.code-workspace \
  --profile "Core / Base Dev"
----

== Bundle path (no repo edits)

Use a prebuilt bundle zip (from `vscode/exports/bundles/<slug>-bundle.zip`):

. Unzip anywhere.
. Run the OS installer in `scripts/` (macOS/Linux shell or Windows PowerShell).
. The installer creates/opens the profile, installs extensions, and opens the workspace.

== Validation

Run Trunk and bundle validation when you change packs or MCP:
+
[source,bash]
----
trunk check
bash vscode/scripts/validate-all-bundles.sh
----
