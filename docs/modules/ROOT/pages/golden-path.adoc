.Golden Path Workflow
Diagram showing the two main paths for setting up a development environment on a new machine.

== Repo-aware path

. Clone the repo and enter the vscode directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
python scripts/export-packs.py core-base-dev
----
. Install extensions into the profile (scoped):
+
[source,bash]
----
cat exports/workspaces/core-base-dev/.vscode/extensions.list | \
  xargs -L1 code --install-extension --profile "Core / Base Dev"
----
. Open the workspace with the profile:
+
[source,bash]
----
code exports/workspaces/core-base-dev/core-base-dev.code-workspace \
  --profile "Core / Base Dev"
----

== Bundle path (no repo edits)

Use a prebuilt bundle zip (from `vscode/exports/bundles/<slug>-bundle.zip`):

. Unzip anywhere.
. Run the OS installer in `scripts/` (macOS/Linux shell or Windows PowerShell).
. The installer creates/opens the profile, installs extensions, and opens the workspace.

== Validation

Run Trunk and bundle validation when you change packs or MCP:
+
[source,bash]
----
trunk check
bash vscode/scripts/validate-all-bundles.sh
----

== Featured flows

[[js-ts-refactor-tests]]
=== JS/TS refactor + tests

- Stack: `fullstack-js-ts`.
- Agents: refactor-surgeon + test-writer; MCP for code search in read-only mode.
- Flow: scope refactor, generate focused tests, run them locally, and stage changes with a review summary.

[[data-pipeline-hardening]]
=== Data pipeline hardening

- Stack: `python-data-analytics`.
- Agents: data-explorer + pipeline-refactorer.
- Flow: lint + type-check notebooks, refactor ETL scripts, and document operational runbooks alongside MCP data fetches.

[[incident-review-postmortem]]
=== Incident review + postmortem

- Stack: `infra-ops-sre`.
- Agents: infra-reviewer + incident-scribe, defaulting to read-only MCP usage.
- Flow: pull logs in read-only mode, assemble a timeline, capture remediation follow-ups, and publish the postmortem.
