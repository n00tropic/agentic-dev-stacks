= Bundles & Exports

Bundles are reproducible ZIPs that contain everything to spin up a profile: workspace, .vscode settings, extensions list, MCP manifests, custom agents, and install scripts.

== Build bundles

[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
python scripts/build-bundles.py            # all slugs
python scripts/build-bundles.py <slug> ... # specific slugs
----

Outputs:

- `vscode/exports/bundles/<slug>/`
- `vscode/exports/bundles/<slug>-bundle.zip`

== Validate bundles

[source,bash]
----
bash vscode/scripts/validate-all-bundles.sh
----

Validation checks structure, JSON/TOML, and (optionally) installs extensions using an isolated VS Code user data directory.

== Install scripts (inside each bundle)

- `scripts/install-macos.sh` / `install-linux.sh`
- `scripts/Install-Windows.ps1`

They call `code --profile` and `--install-extension` and open the workspace.
