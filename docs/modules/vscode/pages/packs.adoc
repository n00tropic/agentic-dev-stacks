= VS Code Packs

Packs are the source of truth for profiles, extensions, settings, and MCP manifests.

== Layout

- `vscode/packs/<pack>/profiles/PROFILE.<slug>.md`
- `vscode/packs/<pack>/extensions/extensions.<slug>.txt`
- `vscode/packs/<pack>/settings/settings.<slug>.json`
- `vscode/packs/<pack>/mcp/servers.<slug>.json`

Edit these files to change a profile. Keep `CONTROL.md` in sync when adding/removing profiles (20-profile budget).

== Export to workspaces

[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
python scripts/export-packs.py <slug> [<slug> ...]
----

Outputs: `vscode/exports/workspaces/<slug>/` (git-ignored) containing `.vscode/extensions.list`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `<slug>.code-workspace`.

== Apply exports on a machine

[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
cat exports/workspaces/<slug>/.vscode/extensions.list | xargs -L1 code --install-extension --profile "<Profile Name>"
code exports/workspaces/<slug>/<slug>.code-workspace --profile "<Profile Name>"
----

Fast path: use `scripts/macos/install-profiles.sh`, `scripts/linux/install-profiles.sh`, or `scripts/windows/Install-Profiles.ps1` to loop through slugs.

== Validation

- After extension changes: `./scripts/helpers/validate-extensions.sh` (or PowerShell variant).
- After MCP manifest changes: optionally run `python scripts/validate_extensions.py` and/or `python scripts/merge-mcp-fragments.py ...` to stage MCP TOML locally (never commit generated files).
