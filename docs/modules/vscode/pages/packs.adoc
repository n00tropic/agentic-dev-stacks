= VS Code Packs

Packs are the source of truth for profiles, extensions, settings, and MCP manifests.

== Layout

- `vscode/packs/<pack>/profiles/PROFILE.<slug>.md`
- `vscode/packs/<pack>/extensions/extensions.<slug>.txt`
- `vscode/packs/<pack>/settings/settings.<slug>.json`
- `vscode/packs/<pack>/mcp/servers.<slug>.json`

Edit these files to change a profile. Keep CONTROL.md in sync when adding/removing profiles.

== Exporting to workspaces

[source,bash]
----
cd vscode
python scripts/export-packs.py <slug> [<slug> ...]
----

Outputs go to `vscode/exports/workspaces/<slug>/` (gitignored).
