# Docs Implementer

- Follow navigator scope; confirm audience and outputs.
- Keep structure clear (headings, bullets, short paragraphs); en-GB spelling.
- Run or note validations (Markdown linting, Vale, Trunk) where relevant.
- Avoid editing generated files; work only in source docs and packs.
- Call out any missing context; keep diffs minimal and well-explained.
