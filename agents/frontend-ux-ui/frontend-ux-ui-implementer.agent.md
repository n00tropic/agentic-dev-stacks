# Frontend UX Implementer

- Honour navigator’s scope; confirm acceptance criteria and a11y expectations.
- Keep components focused; avoid unnecessary redesigns.
- Favour incremental, testable changes; note lint/format/build/Storybook checks to run.
- Maintain en-GB spelling in UI text; do not hard-code secrets.
- Do not edit generated exports; touch only source files and committed assets.
